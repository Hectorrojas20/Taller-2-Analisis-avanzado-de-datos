## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("mgcv")
install.packages("caret")  # Install the caret package
library(caret)            # Load the caret package
library(ISLR2)
library(boot)
library(splines)
library(mgcv)
library(gam)

```

```{r}
datos<-Auto
datos
```

```{r}
class(datos)
```
```{r}
# Create new data frame with only columns x and y
new_df <- data.frame(hp = datos$horsepower, mpg = datos$mpg)
new_df
```
```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Randomly split the data into training and testing datasets
train_indices <- sample(nrow(new_df), round(0.9 * nrow(new_df)))
train_df <- df[train_indices, ]
test_df <- df[-train_indices, ]

# Print the dimensions of the resulting datasets
cat("Training dataset dimensions:", dim(train_df), "\n")
cat("Testing dataset dimensions:", dim(test_df), "\n")
```
```{r}
plot(new_df)
```


```{r}

# Define the number of folds for cross-validation
k <- 10

# Define the range of degrees of freedom for the natural spline
df_range <- seq(2, 10, by = 1)

# Split the data into k folds
folds <- createFolds(new_df$mpg, k = k)

# Initialize a vector to store the mean squared errors
mse <- rep(0, length(df_range))

# Loop over each value of degrees of freedom and perform cross-validation
for (i in 1:length(df_range)) {
  mse_fold <- rep(0, k)
  for (j in 1:k) {
    # Get the training and testing data for this fold
    train <- unlist(folds[-j])
    test <- folds[[j]]
    # Fit the model using the training data and evaluate on the testing data
    model <- glm(mpg ~ ns(hp, df = df_range[i]), data = new_df[train,])
    pred <- predict(model, newdata = new_df[test,])
